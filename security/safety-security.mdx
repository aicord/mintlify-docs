# Safety and Security

## Key handling

- Never commit API keys to Git.
- Use secret management in production.
- Rotate tenant keys on schedule.

## Access control

- Use least-privilege for panel and server access.
- Restrict management commands to owner/admin IDs.

## Runtime guardrails

- Enforce request timeouts.
- Use rate limits per tenant.
- Use queue and backpressure to prevent overload.

## Logging policy

- Log status codes, latency, tier, and upstream route.
- Do not log full secrets.
- Keep incident timeline for postmortems.

## Licensing and distribution

- Keep Paid package and support policy explicit.
- Keep trial restrictions documented to avoid misuse.
