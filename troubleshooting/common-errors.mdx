# 🆘 Troubleshooting

> Fast diagnosis for the most common production failures.

| Error | Typical cause | Immediate fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Wrong/rotated key | Validate key + header format and restart bot |
| `429 Rate limit` | Burst too high | Reduce burst, increase tier limits, queue requests |
| `Timeout` | CPU saturation or long prompts | Reduce tokens and route heavy prompts to fallback |
| `502 Upstream` | Local/remote upstream unavailable | Verify upstream process, URL, key, and failover |
| Billing/quota | No credits | Refill billing and confirm provider account status |

## 🔍 401 Unauthorized

## 🔍 429 Rate limit

## 🔍 Timeout / slow response

- Lower max tokens
- Route heavy tasks to remote fallback
- Reassess local model profile
