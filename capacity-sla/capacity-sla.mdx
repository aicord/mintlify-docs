# <img src="/icons/capacity.svg" alt="Capacity icon" width="22" /> Capacity and SLA

Conservative launch targets for stable operation.

## Baseline profile

- 8 vCPU
- 24 GB RAM
- NVMe storage
- CPU-only hybrid routing

## Safe launch capacity

- 10-20 concurrent users

## SLO targets

- `p95 <= 4s` for short requests
- `p95 <= 8s` for complex requests

## Scaling policy

When sustained concurrency exceeds safe range:

1. Tighten queue and limits
2. Shift heavy tiers to remote upstream
3. Add instances or move local inference to GPU
