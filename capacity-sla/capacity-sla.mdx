# Capacity and SLA

This page publishes conservative operational targets for launch.

## Baseline profile

- 8 vCPU
- 24 GB RAM
- NVMe storage
- CPU-only hybrid routing

## Safe launch capacity

- 10-20 concurrent users (launch target)

## SLO targets

- `p95 <= 4s` for short requests
- `p95 <= 8s` for complex requests

## What affects performance

- Prompt length
- Token output limit
- Local model profile
- Queue depth and upstream health

## Scaling policy

If sustained concurrency exceeds safe range:

1. Increase queue controls and limits.
2. Shift heavy tiers to remote upstream.
3. Add more instances or move local inference to GPU.

## Commercial guidance

Do not promise unlimited concurrency.
Publish ranges and monitor real production telemetry.
