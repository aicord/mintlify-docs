# 📈 Capacity and SLA

> Conservative launch targets to protect quality and trust.

## 🧱 Baseline profile

- 8 vCPU
- 24 GB RAM
- NVMe storage
- CPU-only hybrid routing

## 👥 Safe launch capacity

- 10-20 concurrent users

## ⏱️ SLO targets

- `p95 <= 4s` for short requests
- `p95 <= 8s` for complex requests

## 🔬 Performance drivers

- Prompt length
- Output token cap
- Local model profile
- Queue depth and upstream health

## 📊 Scaling policy

When sustained concurrency exceeds safe range:

1. Tighten queue and limits
2. Shift heavy tiers to remote upstream
3. Add instances or move local inference to GPU

## 💼 Commercial guidance

Do not promise unlimited concurrency.
Publish safe ranges and monitor real telemetry.
