# Operations Runbook

This runbook defines day-to-day operation and incident handling.

## Service lifecycle

- Start: process manager command
- Restart: rolling restart if multiple instances, otherwise controlled restart window
- Stop: only during maintenance

## Daily checks

1. Health endpoint status
2. Error rate in logs
3. p95 latency trend
4. Queue pressure (if enabled)
5. Upstream fallback ratio

## Weekly checks

1. API key rotation policy audit
2. Dependency update window
3. Backup validation (configs, env templates, docs)

## Incident procedure

1. Classify severity (P1/P2/P3)
2. Capture current symptoms and timeline
3. Mitigate first (failover, temporary limits)
4. Root cause analysis after stabilization
5. Publish incident summary internally

## Deployment policy

- PR required for docs and operational changes
- No direct changes on production host without change note
- Rollback path must be documented before release
