# <img src="/icons/process.svg" alt="Process icon" width="22" /> Documentation Process

Rules for keeping docs accurate and deploy-safe.

## Workflow

1. Open PR with clear scope
2. Technical review (accuracy and commands)
3. Merge after approval

## Consistency rules

- Every command example must be executable
- Every environment variable must exist in `.env.example`
- API examples must match current endpoint behavior

## Changelog policy

Update [Documentation Updates](../changelog/documentation-updates) for every relevant release.
