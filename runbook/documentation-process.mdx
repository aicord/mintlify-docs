# Documentation Process

This process keeps EN/PT docs consistent and production-safe.

## Workflow

1. Open PR with clear scope and affected pages.
2. Technical review (accuracy + commands).
3. Language review (EN/PT parity).
4. Merge after both approvals.

## Consistency rules

- Every EN update must include PT update in same PR, or a linked follow-up issue with due date.
- Every command example must be executable as written.
- Every env var referenced in docs must exist in `.env.example`.

## Changelog policy

Update [Documentation Updates](../changelog/documentation-updates) on each relevant release.
