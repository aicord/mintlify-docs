# 📝 Documentation Process

> Keep EN/PT docs accurate, aligned, and production-safe.

## 🔁 Workflow

1. Open PR with clear scope and affected pages
2. Technical review (accuracy + commands)
3. Language review (EN/PT parity)
4. Merge only after approvals

## ✅ Consistency rules

- EN update requires PT update in same PR, or linked follow-up issue
- Every command example must be executable
- Every env var must exist in `.env.example`

## 📚 Changelog policy

Update [Documentation Updates](../changelog/documentation-updates) for each relevant release.
